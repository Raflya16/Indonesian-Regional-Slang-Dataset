# Indonesian-Regional-Slang-Dataset

This dataset contains a curated lexicon for normalizing informal Indonesian slang words, with a specific focus on regional dialects often found in social media discourse. The dataset aims to address the issue of "lexical deserts" in Indonesian NLP by providing a direct mapping from noisy/slang tokens to their formal Indonesian equivalents.
